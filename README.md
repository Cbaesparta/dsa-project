# Music Player Using Data Structures  

This project was developed as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithm (CSE2003)** course. It demonstrates the practical implementation of core data structures in C++ by building a basic music player.  

The project combines doubly linked lists, stacks, queues, and file handling to provide simple but functional music player features such as navigating, playing, and storing songs.

## Features  
- Add and delete songs to manage your playlist.  
- Play next and previous songs using a doubly linked list.  
- View recently played songs using a stack.  
- Manage upcoming songs with a queue.  
- Save and retrieve the playlist across sessions with file handling.

## Data Structures Used  
- **Doubly Linked List** – Playlist navigation (next/previous).  
- **Stack** – Track history (recently played songs).  
- **Queue** – Manage upcoming songs.  
- **File Handling** – Save and load songs to and from text files.
